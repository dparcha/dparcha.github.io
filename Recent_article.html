				<p><strong>Are the tweets by the games studios behind "Terraria" and "Don't Starve" red-herrings?</strong><br>People are getting excited for a possible collaboration between Terraria and Don't Starve by the tweets made by their developers Re-Logic, and Klei Entertainment. The tweets in question were dark images of the developers with a little surprise hidden which can only be discovered by brightening the images. The image tweeted by the developers of Don't Starve features Terraria's first boss, Eye of Cthulu, in the art style of Don't Starve while the image tweeted by Re-Logic features the boss Deerclops in the 8-bit artstyle of Terraria within a blizzard in the game's snow biome. Both communities are excited for this possible tease especially those in the Terraria community as the game had just released its supposed last update which was a relief as they didn't want to see a massive sandbox game to stop at development.</p>
